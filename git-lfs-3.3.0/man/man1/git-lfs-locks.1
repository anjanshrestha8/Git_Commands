.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-locks \- Lists currently locked files from the Git LFS server.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs locks\fP [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Lists current locks from the Git LFS server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-r <name>\fP, \f(CR\-\-remote=<name>\fP
.RS 4
Specify the Git LFS server to use. Ignored if the \f(CRlfs.url\fP config key is
set.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-i <id>\fP, \f(CR\-\-id=<id>\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a lock by its ID. Returns a single result.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-p <path>\fP, \f(CR\-\-path=<path>\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a lock by its path. Returns a single result.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-local\fP
.RS 4
Lists only our own locks which are cached locally. Skips a remote call.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-cached\fP
.RS 4
  Lists cached locks from the last remote call. Contrary to \f(CR\-\-local\fP, this will
include locks of other users as well. This option is intended to display the
last known locks in case you are offline. There is no guarantee that locks on
the server have not changed in the
meanwhile.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-verify\fP
.RS 4
Verifies the lock owner on the server and marks our own locks by \*(AqO\*(Aq. Own
locks are actually held by us and corresponding files can be updated for the
next push. All other locks are held by someone else. Contrary to \-\-local, this
option will also detect locks which are held by us despite no local lock
information being available (e.g. because the file had been locked from a
different clone); it will also detect \*(Aqbroken\*(Aq locks (e.g. if someone else has
forcefully unlocked our files).
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-l <num>\fP, \f(CR\-\-limit=<num>\fP
.RS 4
Specifies number of results to return.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-json\fP
.RS 4
Writes lock info as JSON to STDOUT if the command exits successfully. Intended
for interoperation with external tools. If the command returns with a non\-zero
exit code, plain text messages will be sent to STDERR.
