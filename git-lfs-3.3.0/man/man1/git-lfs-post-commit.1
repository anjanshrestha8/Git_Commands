.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-post-commit \- Git post\-commit hook implementation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs post\-commit\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Responds to Git post\-commit events. It makes sure that any files which
are marked as lockable by \f(CRgit lfs track\fP are read\-only in the working
copy, if not currently locked by the local user.
.sp
Where the \f(CRgit lfs post\-merge\fP command, which has a similar purpose,
must examine all files in the working copy, \f(CRgit lfs post\-commit\fP can
limit itself checking only those files which have changed in \f(CRHEAD\fP. It
primarily handles newly added lockable files which have not yet been
made read\-only.
