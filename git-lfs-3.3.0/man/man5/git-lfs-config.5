git-lfs-config \- Configuration options for git\-lfs
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.sp
git\-lfs reads its configuration from any file supported by
\f(CRgit config \-l\fP, including all per\-repository, per\-user, and per\-system
Git configuration files.
.sp
Additionally, a small number of settings can be specified in a file
called \f(CR.lfsconfig\fP at the root of the repository; see the "LFSCONFIG"
section for more details. This configuration file is useful for setting
options such as the LFS URL or access type for all users of a
repository, especially when these differ from the default. The
\f(CR.lfsconfig\fP file uses the same format as \f(CR.gitconfig\fP.
.sp
If the \f(CR.lfsconfig\fP file is missing, the index is checked for a version
of the file, and that is used instead. If both are missing, \f(CRHEAD\fP is
checked for the file. If the repository is bare, only \f(CRHEAD\fP is checked.
This order may change for checkouts in the future to better match Git\(cqs
behavior.
.sp
Settings from Git configuration files override the \f(CR.lfsconfig\fP file.
This allows you to override settings like \f(CRlfs.url\fP in your local
environment without having to modify the \f(CR.lfsconfig\fP file.
.sp
Most options regarding git\-lfs are contained in the \f(CR[lfs]\fP section,
meaning they are all named \f(CRlfs.foo\fP or similar, although occasionally
an lfs option can be scoped inside the configuration for a remote.

The git\-lfs client supports basic HTTP downloads, resumable HTTP
downloads (using \f(CRRange\fP headers), and resumable uploads via tus.io
protocol. Custom transfer methods can be added via \f(CRlfs.customtransfer\fP

\f(CRlfs.customtransfer.<name>.path\fP
.sp
\f(CRlfs.customtransfer.<name>\fP is a settings group which defines a custom
transfer hook which allows you to upload/download via an intermediate
process, using any mechanism you like (rather than just HTTP). \f(CRpath\fP
should point to the process you wish to invoke. The protocol between the
git\-lfs client and the custom transfer process is documented at
.URL "https://github.com/git\-lfs/git\-lfs/blob/main/docs/custom\-transfers.md" "" ""
.sp
must be a unique identifier that the LFS server understands. When
calling the LFS API the client will include a list of supported transfer
types. If the server also supports this named transfer type, it will
select it and actions returned from the API will be in relation to that
transfer type (may not be traditional URLs for example). Only if the
server accepts as a transfer it supports will this custom transfer
process be invoked.

between each retry until reaching this limit. If a server requests a
delay using the \f(CRRetry\-After\fP header, the header value overrides the
exponential delay for that attempt and is not limited by this option.

Sets whether or not Git LFS will skip attempting to convert pointers of
files tracked into their corresponding objects when checked out into a
working copy. If \*(Aqtrue\*(Aq, \*(Aq1\*(Aq, \*(Aqon\*(Aq, or similar, Git LFS will skip the
smudge process in both \f(CRgit lfs smudge\fP and \f(CRgit lfs filter\-process\fP. If
unset, or set to \*(Aqfalse\*(Aq, \*(Aq0\*(Aq, \*(Aqoff\*(Aq, or similar, Git LFS will smudge
files as normal.

Sets whether or not Git LFS will attempt to upload new Git LFS object in

pre\-push hook, so no new Git LFS objects will be uploaded. If unset, or
set to \*(Aqfalse\*(Aq, \*(Aq0\*(Aq, \*(Aqoff\*(Aq, or similar, Git LFS will proceed as normal.

\f(CRGIT_LFS_SET_LOCKABLE_READONLY\fP \f(CRlfs.setlockablereadonly\fP

These settings, the first an environment variable and the second a
gitconfig setting, control whether files marked as \*(Aqlockable\*(Aq in
\f(CRgit lfs track\fP are made read\-only in the working copy when not locked
by the current user. The default is \f(CRtrue\fP; you can disable this
behaviour and have all files writeable by setting either variable to 0,
\*(Aqno\*(Aq or \*(Aqfalse\*(Aq.

This setting controls whether Git LFS will set ignored files that match

\*(Aqyes\*(Aq, or \*(Aqtrue\*(Aq.

This setting sets a default token TTL when git\-lfs\-authenticate does not
